          Is <strong>beauty</strong> objectively true? Are there principles you
          can use to guide you to it in your work? Can designers from both the
          sciences and the arts look at each others work and find
          <strong class="sevenhundred">beauty</strong>? These are important
          questions for all designers.

          For those of us who design things … we need to be able to recognize
          it. We need good taste to make good things. Instead of treating
          <strong class="eighthundred">beauty</strong> as an airy abstraction,
          to be either blathered about or avoided depending on how one feels
          about airy abstractions, let’s try considering it as a practical
          question: how do you make good stuff?
